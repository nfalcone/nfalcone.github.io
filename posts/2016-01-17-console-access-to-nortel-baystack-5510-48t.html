<p>For my homelab setup I purchased a Baystack 5510-48T, this filled my need for a manageable (semi)Layer 3 switch and at a great price. I really wanted some cisco gear but it was just way out of budget for the home.<br />
<img src="../images/switch.jpg" /></p>
<p>I snagged the switch off ebay for ~$50 which is amazing for 48 gig ports. After racking, I needed to console into the device to set an IP and make sure telnet was working. This turned to be a little more difficult than I expected.</p>
<p>First I used a null modem cable, which after doing a little research found out will not work. Reading online some posts state that it requires an official Nortel console cable, well I did not belive that (or want to) as the official cable cost more than the switch on ebay. So I did more reading and found it seems to only need a straight through serial cable like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-6-Feet-Straight-Through-Serial/dp/B00066HP2E">one from amazon</a>. Combining that cable with my usb to serial adapter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-TU-S9-USB-Serial-Converter/dp/B0007T27H8">like this one</a>.</p>
<p>I used ubuntu to get into the switch but if you are using mac or windows you may need to get drivers for the tu-s9 <a href="http://downloads.trendnet.com/tu-s9/Driver/">from here</a>. Then download <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">putty</a>.</p>
<p>So first I opened putty and set the serial device as <strong><em>/dev/ttyUSB0</em></strong> (again if you are on windows or mac this will be different). <img src="../images/putty1.png" /></p>
<p>Make sure the settings under serial are set as this as well. <img src="../images/putty2.png" /></p>
<p>I banged my head against the wall for awhile at this, putty still was blank! I had the settings right and the right cable so what was going on. I tried sending <strong>breaks</strong> as well as <strong>CTRL+Y</strong> (remembering this is necessary to see the Nortel Menu) did not work, in addition to just banging on the keyboard. <img src="../images/putty3.png" /></p>
<p>The trick was <strong>CTRL+W</strong>, I found that bit of info at the bottom of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/279268/my_nortel_baystack_552024t_552048t_551048t_in/cm3pcbf">this reddit thread</a> and seemingly nothing else I skimmed through mentioned it.</p>
<p>As soon as I hit <strong>CTRL+W</strong> I was greeted with the Nortel logo like below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/putty4.png" />

</div>
<p>Then, I hit <strong>CTRL+Y</strong> and got the menu I was expecting. <img src="../images/putty5.png" /></p>
<p>From there I went to IP Configuration/Setup and filled in my settings, donâ€™t forget to do the <strong>IP Address to Ping:</strong> otherwise it will not fill in the IP under the <strong>In Use</strong> column.</p>

<p>Now I just have to find and install some more up to date firmware, that will be another post.</p>
