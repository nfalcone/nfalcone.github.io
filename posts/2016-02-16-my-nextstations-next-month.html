<p>In honor of <strong>NeXT Month</strong> for the month of February on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations">/r/retrobattlestations</a></p>

<p>Here’s a few pictures of my NeXT gear, I have a NeXTstation, NeXTstation Turbo, and NeXTstation Turbo Color. In the pics I was only able to get my Turbo mono to work. The regular NeXTstation I have is really just for parts and I am still trying to figure out why the Turbo Color does not turn on now (anyone have any ideas? tried new battery and psu).</p>
<p>The NeXTstation Turbo that works is running NeXTStep 3.3 (though I think I need to install the Y2K patch), it has a 250Mb hard drive with 16Mb of RAM. I have a few extra SCSI disks lying around I hope to install OpenSTEP on this soon.</p>
<p>Also I have these fancy cables that let me use the NeXTstations with a “regular” lcd screen. The NeXT Turbo Color is not very hard to get working on a “new” monitor as it uses a 13w3 adapter but the Mono cable was very hard to track down, because it is such an odd proprietary connector. The Monitor is a Dell 2007FPb which works with most Unix workstations with weird graphics adapters.</p>
